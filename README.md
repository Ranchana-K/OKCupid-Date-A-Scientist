# OKCupid - Date a Scientist

This project is a part of Codecademy – Data scientist career path. Dating applications are popular these days and OKCupid is one of them – getting information of users' preferences and trying to match couples. In exception of general information, some users believe that zodiac signs may be a good signal to indicate whether they can get along with another user given zodiac sign. However, some users do not mind about identifying their signs in their profiles. The initial goal of this project is to create a model that can predict signs for users who do not inform them. 


# Files Description
- OKCupid-date-a-scientist.ipynb - a notebook with the code to explore the data and train some machine learning models  

# Summary
To predict a sign, this project used four machine learning models for multi-class classification: K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models, and MultinomialNB. The models' accuracy is about 30%, 87%, 20% and 30%, respectively on training data. Unfortunately, after cross-validation, the accuracy of these four models are very low at about 3-8%. There might be a lot of work to go on in order to create better models, for example, discussing data features that are better for sign prediction with astrologers! :grinning:
